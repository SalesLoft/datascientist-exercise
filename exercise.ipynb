Instead, copy-paste this notebook together with the `touches.sqlite3` file to a separate folder in your machine, type your answers in that copied notebook, and when you're done, share the new Jupyter notebook back with the recruiter together with additional modules, graphs etc. that you may have. You would need to use the data in the `touches.sqlite3` file to answer all the questions."
